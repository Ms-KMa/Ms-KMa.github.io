		<h1>Cybersecurity Summer</h1>
		<h2> Tuesday, 07/17/18</h2>
		<h3> So Much Info, So Little Time! </h3>
<p>Wow, I can't believe we are already in the second week of this program. That means that we are almost halfway done. Last week was so intense because I came into the program with absolutely no knowledge about coding. It made me extremely nervous that I would have to go back to my school with the small amount of summer training about a whole curriculum. Thankfully, the instructors and the other participants in the program are very supportive and helpful. I find all the topics to be interesting, even if it has caused me some paranoia. I can't wait to share all the things I learned with others.
