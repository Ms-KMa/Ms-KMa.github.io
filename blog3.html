		<h1>More Cyber Info</h1>
		<h2> Tuesday, 07/24/18</h2>
		<h3> Almost There! </h3>
<p>	We are almost at the end of the CS4CS summer camp. This week, we are continuing the major challenge that we left off last Thursday. We have just installed "Ariana Venti's" laptop and will be using the various hacks we learned to extract information and solve the case later. So far, we have learned about databases and how to perform queries and SQL injections. This is very interesting and nerve-racking, knowing that hackers can be lurking around everywhere. Basically, the more I learn about cybersecurity, the more paranoid I get. 
</p>
<p> I have mixed feelings this week. I am excited that we will be finishing the program but I am nervous about how we will be using all this information for an after-school curriculum when the school year begins. There is some time left to plan, which puts me at ease a bit. Let's see where this cybersecurity adventure takes us!
